# Apollonia Dental Practice - Employee Management Database

## **Overview**

This database is designed to manage the employees and departments of the Apollonia Dental Practice. It follows a normalized schema to efficiently store and retrieve information about employees, departments, and their relationships. The design is flexible and scalable to accommodate additional features such as patient management and project assignments.

### 3. **`employee_departments` Collection**

A junction table linking employees to their departments, enabling a many-to-many relationship.

| Field           | Type   | Description                                                           |

| `employee_id`   | String | References the `_id` of an employee in the `employees` collection.    |
| `department_id` | String | References the `_id` of a department in the `departments` collection. |

**Example Entry:**

## **How the Database Works**

### **Data Storage:**

1. **Departments** are stored uniquely in the `departments` collection.
2. **Employees** are stored in the `employees` collection with personal and professional details.
3. Relationships between employees and departments are managed in the `employee_departments` collection.

### **Example Scenarios:**

1. **Retrieve all employees in a department:**

   - Query the `employee_departments` table for records with the department's `_id`.
   - Use the resulting `employee_id` values to fetch employee details from the `employees` table.

2. **Find all departments an employee belongs to:**

   - Query the `employee_departments` table for records with the employee's `_id`.
   - Use the resulting `department_id` values to fetch department names from the `departments` table.

3. **Update an employee's department:**
   - Modify or insert the relationship in the `employee_departments` table.

## **Advantages of the Schema**

- **Avoids Redundancy:** Employee and department data are stored only once.
- **Scalable:** Can easily accommodate new features like project management or patient assignments.
- **Efficient Updates:** Changes to employee or department details only affect a single collection.
- **Flexibility:** Allows for complex queries like multi-department assignments or department-wide employee retrieval.

## **Next Steps**

1. **Expand the Schema:** Add tables for `projects` or `patients` as needed.
2. **Develop the UI:** Create a user interface for CRUD operations on this database.
3. **Integrate REST API:** Use a Node.js server and MongoDB to enable interaction with the database.
4. **Package with Docker:** Ensure the database and server can be easily deployed in any environment.
